Rework routing to make CrochetApp the home page
Rework Labels and drop down imputs to be
  a) fixed size
  b) font and format better - more friendly/less businesslike
Rework imaging to advance after the Project and Size are selected to the select yarn weight image
Rework imaging to advance after the project, size and weight are selected to the generate button image
Create "Generate" button
Enable generate button once the values are selected

Upon pressing the generate button, get follow along instructions to display on a non-visible route.

Future Features----------------
On project selection page:
  Add a open project button
    - this would check for any bookmarked projects and return the user to the place in the follow-along that was last bookmarked
    -bookmarks are to be nameable, (i.e. sweater_project-medium) for easy finding.
    -bookmarks should be allowed to be deleted after opening the project.

On the project instruction page:
  Add a button for adding a bookmark
    -only enable if the project does not already have a bookmark
  Add a button for saving project progress
    -only enable if teh project does have a bookmark
    -this moves the bookmark to the new place in the instructions
  Add a modifiable counter
    -many instructions likely will state to repeat x number of rows?
    -this will allow the user to put the row count they were on when they choose to save so they know where they are when they come back.

Considerations----------------
Do we make the instructions downloadable as a pdf?
Do we make instructable videos - with links to the videos from the instruction screen (i.e. This is how to do this stitch. This is how to connect one weight to another. etc)
